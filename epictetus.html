            <p style="font-size: 30px; line-height: 1.6;">
                Epictetus, born around 55 AD, was a Greek Stoic philosopher who overcame early challenges as a slave to become a renowned teacher. His teachings, recorded by his student Arrian in the "Discourses" and the "Enchiridion," emphasize the Stoic principles of personal ethics, self-discipline, and rationality.
                Epictetus focused on the importance of accepting what is beyond our control and cultivating inner virtues. His profound insights on freedom, happiness, and the nature of the human condition have left a lasting impact on Stoic philosophy. Epictetus' timeless wisdom continues to resonate with individuals seeking a meaningful and virtuous life.
