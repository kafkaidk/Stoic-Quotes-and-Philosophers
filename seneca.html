            <p style="font-size: 30px; line-height: 1.6;">
                Seneca the Younger, born around 4 BC, was a Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, and playwright. He rose to prominence as one of the wealthiest individuals in the Roman Empire, serving as an advisor to Emperor Nero. Seneca's philosophical works, including essays and letters, explore the Stoic principles of virtue, ethics, and the nature of a good life.
                His tragedies, such as "Phaedra" and "Medea," are considered classics of Roman literature. Seneca's writings continue to influence and inspire those seeking wisdom in navigating life's challenges.
